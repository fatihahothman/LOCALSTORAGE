"TITLE":"The Hazards of Electric Current",

"BODY":["The hazards of electric current mainly depend on the strength and duration of the current passing through the human body.",

"There is a difference between the hazard related to direct current (DC) and that with alternating current (AC). AC is more dangerous than DC. As regards AC, the level of danger varies depending on the frequency. Frequencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz are dangerous to the human body, whereas frequencies below and above these values are less dangerous."],

"BODY":["In selecting a screwdriver for electrical work, be sure that it has a non--conducting handle. The screwdriver should not be used as a substitute for a punch or a chisel, and care should be taken that one is selected of the correct size to fit the screw.",

"When using a fuse puller, ensure that it is the correct type and size for the particular fuse to be pulled.",

"The soldering iron is a fire hazard and a potential source of burns. Always assume that a soldering iron is hot; never rest the iron anywhere but on a metal surface or rack provided for that purpose.",

"Keep the iron holder in the open to minimise the danger of fire from accumulated heat. Do not shake the iron to dispose of excess solder; a drop of hot solder may hit someone, or it may strike the equipment and cause a short circuit. Hold small parts to be soldered with pliers or clamps.",

"When cleaning the iron, place the cleaning rag on a suitable surface and wipe the iron across it; do not hold the rag in the hand. Disconnect the iron when leaving the work, even for a short time; the delay may be longer than intended."],

"For any cleaning on electrical or electronic equipment it is not allowed to use alcohol, gasoline, benzine, ether or other volatile substances. Only non--volatile solvents should be used.",

"Many cleaning solvents are very toxic and capable of damaging the human respiratory (breathing) system in case of prolonged inhalation."],

"BODY":["If the victim needs assistance in breathing, first clear the mouth of any food particles, foreign objects, or loose dentures.",

"When a victim becomes unconscious, the muscles relax and the tongue may slide back into the airway blocking it.",

"To open the airway in this situation, the head or jaw tilt technique is recommended.",

"The head tilt technique is performed with the victim on his back and the rescuer kneeling at his side -- head and neck in line with the victim. Place one hand on the victimu2019s forehead and the other under his neck. Apply pressure on the forehead and at the same time lift the neck. Tilting the head in this manner opens the airway.",

"To check for breathing, look for chest movement or put your ear next to the victimu2019s nose and mouth to listen and feel for breath."],
