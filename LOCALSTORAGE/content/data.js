The latter is an institution founded in Paris by an international standardization committee, mainly by representatives of nations of Central Europe. The international committee adopted the metric system in 1875. At the turn to the 19<sup>th</sup> century more than 30 nations had adopted the metric system.",

The kilogram prototype is, also, made of platinum--iridium alloy. It is a cylinder of 39 mm diameter and 39 mm height.

			"The second was previously defined as a fraction of 1/31,556,925.974,74, related to the solar year 1900. According to the given number of seconds in the year, the SI standard atomic clock should be accurate to an allowance of one second within 10<sup>12</sup>/31,556,925.974,74 = 316,455 years.",

			"The concept of time can be associated with many aspects. Presence, past and future are concepts related to the instantaneous awareness of individuals. However to describe events in the past, in the future or the duration of events, time intervals are needed, and the second is the internationally accepted time interval unit.",

			"The solar system gives natural intervals, which count in years, as the earth travels in orbit round the sun, and in days, as the earth rotates on its own axis. Smaller intervals are the hour, the minute and the second, and these are man--made intervals, which have been invented a long time ago, in accordance with the progress in time measurement precision.",

			"The second is the smallest one of the conventional time interval units. Irrespective of that, it is based on observance of the solar system, as described above. Years and days have different lengths. Because of this fact, leap years had to be invented. For the same reason, the second is based on a man--made concept, the mean solar year.",

			"The length of the years and days vary for several reasons. The major reasons lie in the facts that the earth’s orbit about the sun is elliptical.",

			"The earth’s own rotary axis tumbles periodically during a year (known as precession) and the tumble centre axis, additionally, is inclined toward the rotary plane about the sun by a constant degree.",

			"Smaller time variations are due to erosion of mountains, the shifting of continents, the tidal friction, interstellar position changes, seasonal and long--term weather changes, including melting ice caps, wind speed and wind friction. In fact, experiments involving atomic clocks have revealed that the speed of the earth’s rotation, slowly, but continually decreases. Eventually, a re--definition of the time unit might be required, if the basic adherence to the cyclic, natural events is maintained.",

			"As mentioned before, a hexadecimal system has 16 different numbers or figures. There are only 10 numbers in the normal decimal system and therefore it has been agreed that the letters A to F are used in hexadecimal systems.",

			"Refer to Figure LEERER MERKER.",

			"In computer technique it is common that a single character contains 8 bits which are called one ’word’. To represent one character, e.g. ’Z’, 8 lines within a computer are necessary to transmit this character, from the keyboard to the monitor for instance.",

			"During transmission of the character the current at the 8 lines is on or off, e.g.:",

			"line 1 -- no current = 0",

			"line 2 -- current = 1",

			"line 3 -- no current = 0",

			"line 7 -- current = 1",

			"line 8 -- no current = 0",

			"This bit combination represents the letter ’Z’. In order to simplify this combination it is divided into two 4--bit groups: 0101 and 1010. The hexadecimal number for 0101 is ’5’ and for 1010 is ’A’, so the combination 0101 1010 can simply be expressed as 5A(H), whereby the letter H is the abbreviation of hexadecimal.",
